## Ingredients
1 gallon distilled water, 3 lbs. Iowa Ebert Honey (Lynnville IA), 1 teaspoon yeast nutrient, Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast

## Preparation
Bring 3 gallons of distilled water to a vigorous boil for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and add 9 lbs. honey, stir until dissolved.  Return to heat and bring back to a boil for 30 minutes.  At 10 minutes remaining in the boil, add 3 teaspoons yeast nutrient.  Chill to 70F, aerate well, and divide equally to 3 primary fermenters.  

Sprinkle the Pasteur Champagne yeast on the must in the second fermenter.

## Brew Notes
I didn't remember to check the pH until after the yeast to each primary fermenter.  The pH was a bit high, but I didn't feel confident that I could lower the pH consistently for each batch so instead I decided to leave it as it was. Refractometer read 22.5 Brix (1.094). Hydrometer reading was 1.100.  Took the average of the two readings to get 1.097 for the OG.

No signs of fermentation in the first 3 hours.  Light bubbling (30-45 second intervals) in the airlock at about 10 hours. The bulk of the heavy fermentation finished about 1 week later, with the Montrachet yeast finishing about 2 days sooner.   Racked to seconday at 2 week mark.
