Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, .5 lbs. Briess Victory, .25 lbs. English Dark Crystal, .25 lbs English Chocolate Malt, 6 lbs. Amber LME, 2 lbs. Wheat DME, 2 oz. Kent Goldings (bittering), 1 oz. UK Fuggles (aromatic), Safale US-05## RecipeThis was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/oatmeal-stout.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/614/Brushfire-Smoked-Brown-Ale-Recipe.pdf).## Brew NotesI steeped the grains for 20 minutes in 3 gallons of water. Generally did not deviate from the recipe instructions.  I gave it the four or so weeks in the secondary and bottled it with about a month before a wedding party.  The gravity reading went up from the secondary (@ 1.016) to the final reading (@ 1.020).  I got a new hydrometer since I accidently broke the one I used for the OG measurement, which could explain the difference or chalk it up to human error.## Tasting NotesI wasn't sure what to expect, online reviews said this would taste like a campfire in your mouth.  To some degrees that was accurate, but it doesn't completely define the beer.  This would pair well with bacon and was very drinkable.  I brought the whole batch along with some others to a wedding party and it was completely gone before the night was over.
