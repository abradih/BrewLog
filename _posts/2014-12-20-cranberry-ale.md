## Ingredients
4 lbs. Gold North Western LME, 3.3 lbs. Munton & Fison Amber DME, 4 lbs. fresh split cranberries, 1.5 oz. Fuggles (bittering), .5 oz. Fuggles (aromatic), 2 teaspoons yeast nutrient, 1 teaspoon pectin enzyme, Munton and Fision dry yeast, 3/4 cup corn sugar for priming

## Recipe
This was an extract recipie from the book [Homebrew Favorites: A Coast-to-Coast Collection of More Than 240 Beer and Ale Recipes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0882666134/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0882666134&linkCode=as2&tag=zombiest-20&linkId=UY6L6PGEVR5I4DIQ).

## Brew Notes
After pasturization I used a wort chiller to bring the temperature down before topping off with water.  Stuck to the lesser 3/4 cup priming sugar to avoid bottle bombs, since I noticed after removing cranberries it seemed the final yield was closer to around 4 gallons.

## Tasting Notes
Fruity!  You might not be able to figure out it was a cranberry ale unless you were told it had cranberries in it, even if you knew it had fruits added.  Has flavors similiar to a fruit lambic.
