## Brew Notes
After pasturization I used a wort chiller to bring the temperature down before topping off with water.  Stuck to the lesser 3/4 cup priming sugar to avoid bottle bombs, since I noticed after removing cranberries it seemed the final yield was closer to around 4 gallons.

## Tasting Notes
Fruity!  You might not be able to figure out it was a cranberry ale unless you were told it had cranberries in it, even if you knew it had fruits added.  Has flavors similiar to a fruit lambic.
