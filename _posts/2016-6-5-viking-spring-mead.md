## Ingredients
3 gallons spring water, 3.92 oz. wild violets, 6.25 oz. dandelion petals, 1.02 oz. white clovers, 1.91 oz. dried roses, 1 lemon with rind (6.46 oz.), 36 golden raisins, 6.96 oz. mulberries, 2 pounds [alfalfa honey](http://www.draperbee.com/), 2 pounds [basswood honey](http://www.draperbee.com/), 1 pound [star thistle honey](http://laneyhoney.com/star-thistle/), 1 pound [orange blossom honey](http://www.draperbee.com/), 1 pound [orange blossom honey with honeycomb](http://www.tropicalblossom.com/), wild yeast

## Recipe
This was a recipe inspired by a recipe in the book [Make Mead Like a Viking: Traditional Techniques for Brewing Natural, Wild-Fermented, Honey-Based Wines and Beers](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Mead-Like-Viking-Wild-Fermented/dp/1603585982). We picked wild dandelions, violets, clovers, and mulberries. 

Bring 3 gallons of water to a boil (we used spring water). Remove the pot from the burner and add the 2 pounds alfalfa pure honey, 2 pounds basswood honey, 1 pound star thistle honey, and 1 pound orange blossom honey. Stir until dissolved and return the pot the burner. Bring to a boil and add the dandelion petals, violets, dried roses, and clovers. Boil for 5-10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the cool to room temperature then add the lemon juice and rind along with the crushed mulberries, raisins, and the remaining jar of orange blossom honey with the honeycomb.

## Brew Notes
We left the must open to the air over night. The next day we stirred vigorously about 5 times throughout the day. After 24 hours we transferred to a primary fermenter with an airlock. The next morning there was some pressure in the airlock but no obviously visible signs of fermentation. We added a second lemon and stirred again.
