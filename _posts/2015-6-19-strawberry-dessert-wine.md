## Ingredients
23.3 lbs. processed and mashed strawberries, 12 lbs. rock candy sugar, 1/4 teaspoon sodium metabisulfite, 5 teaspoons pectic enzymes, 5 teaspoons yeast nutrient, 2 packages Red Star Champagne yeast

## Recipe
We followed the strawberry dessert wine recipe at [eckraus.com](http://www.eckraus.com/wine-making-strawberry).  Another variation on the recipe is available at [winemakermag.com](https://winemakermag.com/652-take-a-sip-of-strawberries).

## Brew Notes
The recipe called for 25 pounds of strawberries, but was unclear about wether that was 25 pounds raw or processed strawberries (probably raw based on the order of the instructions).  We started with about 30-35 pounds and ended up with 23.3 pounds of processed strawberries after trimming the greens, soft or rotten bits, and eating quite a few.  We used a potato masher to mash up the strawberries.  We didn't quite wait a whole 24 hours (closer to 17 hours) before transferring the juice liqueur to the primary fermentation because of time constraints. For kicks we used rock candy sugar instead of table sugar.  And just to be safe we used 2 packages of yeast for a healthy start.
