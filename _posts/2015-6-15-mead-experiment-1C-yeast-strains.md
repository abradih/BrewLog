## Ingredients
1 gallon distilled water, 3 lbs. Iowa Ebert Honey (Lynnville IA), 1 teaspoon yeast nutrient, Red Star Montrachet yeast

## Preparation
Bring 3 gallons of distilled water to a vigorous boil for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and add 9 lbs. honey, stir until dissolved.  Return to heat and bring back to a boil for 30 minutes.  At 10 minutes remaining in the boil, add 3 teaspoons yeast nutrient.  Chill to 70F, aerate well, and divide equally to 3 primary fermenters.  

Sprinkle the Montrachet yeast on the must in the third fermenter.

## Brew Notes
I didn't remember to check the pH until after the yeast to each primary fermenter.  The pH was a bit high, but I didn't feel confident that I could lower the pH consistently for each batch so instead I decided to leave it as it was.

Light bubbling (30-45 second intervals) in the airlock occurred in less than 3 hours.
