## Ingredients
3.3 lbs. Amber LME, 1 lb. Amber DME, 4 oz. Caramel 60L, 4 oz. smoked malt, 4 oz. chocolate, 1 oz. roasted barley, .5 oz Northern Brewer hops (bittering), .5 oz. Willamette hops (aromatic).

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from Brewer's Best that I picked up at the local homebrew store.  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.brewersbestkits.com/pdf/1038%202013%20Scottish%20Ale%20Recipe.pdf).

## Brew Notes
I don't normally repeat brews, but I had a special request for this brew.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter as I did the first time.  Didn't do a secondary fermentation. Bottled a few weeks later.

## Tasting Notes
Of the two batches, the first time I made this kit I think it turned out better (or I had a better memory of it).  It was crisp and light still, but seemed to have a slightly off taste (more bitter than I remembered?).
