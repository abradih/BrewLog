## Ingredients
6 lbs. Dark LME, 8 oz. Rolled Oats, 4 oz. Chocolate Malt, 4 oz. Roasted Barley, 1 oz. Fuggle hops, Munton and Fison Ale Dry Yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/oatmeal-stout.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/62/Oatmeal%20Stout%20Instructions.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Steeped grains for about 20 minutes.  Transferred to secondary fermentation after about 2 weeks.  Bottled a few weeks later when I felt like it.

## Tasting Notes
It was good! :thumbsup:
