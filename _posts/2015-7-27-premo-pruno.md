## Ingredients
6 oz. frozen strawberries, 12 oz. frozen blueberries, 18 oz. frozen blackberries, 24 oz. frozen raspberries, 24 oz. frozen cranberries, ~3/4 of a 46 oz. bottle of Farmers's Pick 100% Mixed Berry cocktail juice, 3 packets of Spike Your Juice yeast 

## Recipe
This recipe is a premium prison wine because it uses equipment and ingredients that I imagine only a well-connected prisoner would get be able to aquire.  First defrost all frozen fruit.  Empty fruit into primary fermentation vessle, and pour in remaining juice coctail.  Using a potato masher (or blunt instrument) crush the fruit as much as possible. Finally crush and disolve one Campden tablet in a glass of water and stir into crushed fruit concentrate.  Wait 24 hours.  Add sugar cubes, stiring until dissolved. Sprinkle contents of yeast packets and seal fermentation vessle with airlock.  Wait until primary fermentation stops, and filter with a cloth towel.  Enjoy.

## Brew Notes
I was moving and had some store-bought frozen fruit that needed to be used up quickly. Sanitization was minimal, just a rinse of the old bucket.
