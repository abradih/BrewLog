## Recipe
This recipe is a premium prison wine because it uses equipment and ingredients that I imagine only a well-connected prisoner would get be able to acquire.  First defrost all frozen fruit.  Empty fruit into primary fermentation vessel, and pour in remaining juice cocktail.  Using a potato masher (or blunt instrument) crush the fruit as much as possible. Sprinkle pectic enzyme over crushed fruit. Finally crush and dissolve one Campden tablet in a glass of water and stir into crushed fruit concentrate.  Wait 24 hours.  Add raisens, prunes, and dried orange and grapefruit peels.  Add sugar, stirring until dissolved. Top off with tap water to 1.75 gallon mark and take hydrometer reading.  Stir in yeast nutrient and then sprinkle contents of yeast packets on top of the must. Seal fermentation vessel with airlock.  Wait until primary fermentation stops, and filter with a cloth towel.  Enjoy and trade for cigarettes or illicit contraband.

## Brew Notes
I was moving and had some store-bought frozen fruit that needed to be used up quickly. Sanitization was minimal, just a rinse of the old bucket.
