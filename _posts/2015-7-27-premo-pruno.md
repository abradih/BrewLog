## Ingredients
~6 oz. frozen strawberries, 12 oz. frozen blueberries, ~18 oz. frozen blackberries, 24 oz. frozen raspberries, 24 oz. frozen cranberries, ~34.5 oz. of [Farmersâ€™ Pick 100% Mixed Berry](http://amzn.to/1MSNFVe) cocktail juice, 3 packets of [Spike Your Juice](http://amzn.to/1U37Fc1) yeast 

## Recipe
This recipe is a premium prison wine because it uses equipment and ingredients that I imagine only a well-connected prisoner would get be able to acquire.  First defrost all frozen fruit.  Empty fruit into primary fermentation vessel, and pour in remaining juice cocktail.  Using a potato masher (or blunt instrument) crush the fruit as much as possible. Finally crush and dissolve one Campden tablet in a glass of water and stir into crushed fruit concentrate.  Wait 24 hours.  Add sugar cubes, stirring until dissolved. Sprinkle contents of yeast packets and seal fermentation vessel with airlock.  Wait until primary fermentation stops, and filter with a cloth towel.  Enjoy and trade for cigarettes or illicit contraband.

## Brew Notes
I was moving and had some store-bought frozen fruit that needed to be used up quickly. Sanitization was minimal, just a rinse of the old bucket.
