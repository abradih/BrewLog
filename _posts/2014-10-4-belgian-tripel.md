## Ingredients
4 lbs. Pilsen DME, 3.15 lbs. Pilsen liquid malt extract, 2 lbs. Clear candi sugar, 8 oz. Caravienne, 4 oz. Aromatic malt, 2 oz. Styrian Goldings, 1 oz. sweet orange peel, and Safbrew Abbaye Dry Brewing Yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/belgian-tripel-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/623/Belgian%20Tripel%20instructions.pdf).

## Brew Notes
My kit was missing the dried orange peel so I ended up using 1 oz. fresh orange peel in place.  Steeped grains for about 20 minutes.  Transferred to secondary fermentation after about 2-3 weeks.  Bottled about two and a half months later.

## Tasting Notes
Nice taste overall.  Orange peel is obviously there, but not over-powering at all.  Its a strong beer for sure.  Reminds me of a Stella Artois on the first part of the sip but ends with a heavier beer hinted with oranges.
