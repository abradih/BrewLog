## Ingredients
3 lbs. Wheat DME, 2 lbs. Pilsen DME, 8 oz. Caramel 10L, 8 oz. Flaked Wheat, 4 oz. Caravienne malt, 1 oz. Willamette hops (bittering), Safbrew T-58 Dry Yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/blonde-ale-bundle-recipe-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/23/Blonde%20Ale%20Instructions.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Used a brew bag for hops.  Left in primary for 4-5 weeks and bottled without a secondary fermentation.

## Tasting Notes
I was hoping for something similar to Peace Tree Brewing's [Blonde Fatale](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/21818/60168/) and I think it came pretty close.
