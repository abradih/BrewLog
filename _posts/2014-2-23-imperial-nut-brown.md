## Ingredients
6.6 lbs. Amber LME, 2 lbs. Amber DME, 8 oz. Maltodextrin, 4 oz. Caramel 80L, 4 oz. Chocolate, 8 oz. Victory grains, 1 oz. Columbus (bittering), 2 oz. Willamette, Safale S-04 dry yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from Brewer's Best that I picked up at the local homebrew store.  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.brewersbestkits.com/pdf/1048%202013%20Imperial%20Nut%20Brown%20Recipe.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter.  Transferred to secondary fermentation after about 2-3 weeks.  Bottled a few weeks later when I felt like it.

## Tasting Notes
After 2-3 weeks in the bottle I tried and was not very happy with it.  The beer was heavy and sweet almost.  I ended up giving a bunch a way and slowly worked on finishing off the rest.  After a month or so I tried it again and found it had gotten much better.  I was sad it was almost gone when it finally hit its prime.
