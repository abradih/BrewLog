Driscoll's golden (*Framboises Jaunes*) raspberries, 1/3 stick Infusion Spiral heavy charred American white oak, 1/2 teaspoon pectin enzyme, 1 teaspoon yeast nutrient, Pasteur Red Star yeast

## Recipe
Bring water to a vigorous boil for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and add honey, stir until dissolved.  Return to heat and bring back to a boil for 30 minutes.  At 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add 6 oz. of red raspberries and 6 oz. of golden raspberries. At 5 minutes remaining add the rest of the red raspberries.

## Brew Notes
We stirred the raspberries up in the must to break them up and hopefully release more juice.
