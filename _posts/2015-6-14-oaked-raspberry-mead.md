## Ingredients
1 gallon spring water, 1 lb. Noble Bee black locust honey, 3/4 lb. SueBee premium clover honey, 12 oz. Driscoll's red (*Framboises Biologiques*) raspberries, 6 oz. Driscoll's golden (*Framboises Jaunes*) raspberries, 1/3 stick Infusion Spiral heavy charred American white oak, 1/2 teaspoon pectin enzyme, 1 teaspoon yeast nutrient, Pasteur Red Star yeast

## Recipe
Bring water to a vigorous boil for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and add honey, stir until dissolved.  Return to heat and bring back to a boil for 30 minutes.  At 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add 6 oz. of red raspberries and 6 oz. of golden raspberries. At 5 minutes remaining add the rest of the red raspberries.  Cool with wort chiller to 70F and stir in 1/2 teaspoon pectin enzyme and 1 teaspoon yeast nutrient.  Aerate well and transfer to primary fermenter.

## Brew Notes
We stirred the raspberries up in the must to break them up and hopefully release more juice. At 2 weeks we racked to secondary and added 1/3 of a stick of a heavily charred American white oak spiral.  We boiled the oak spiral for one hour and then let soak for 24 hours before adding the spiral to the secondary.  Bottled after 4 weeks of secondary.

## Tasting Notes
At bottling the color was a clear light pink.  A definite fruity vanilla-oak aroma is present to noise.  The first flavor to the tongue is a sweet raspberry and then comes a fruit-tartness with an earthy vanilla aftertaste that lingers at the end.
