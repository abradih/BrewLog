## Ingredients
6 lbs. Gold liquid malt extract, 2 lbs. Light dried malt extract, 1 lb. 6-row malt, 1 lb. rolled oats, 4 oz. Carapils, 8 oz. Roasted Barley, 8 oz. Caramel 120, 1 oz. Chinook, 2 oz. Spalt, 1.6 lbs. chocolate malt, 4 oz. cocoa nibs, 2 6.5-oz. jars dried peanut butter, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, Safale US-05 Dry Yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/chocolate-covered-beavr-nutz-beer-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/431/BEAVR%20Nutz%20Instructions%20v.2.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Steeped grains for about 45 minutes.  Transferred to secondary fermentation after a week.  Added the 1/4 cup of optional cocoa powder.  Bottled about a month later.

## Tasting Notes
Tasting after secondary was not good...very bitter.  You really need to wait the 2-12 months the recipie claims.  After 3 or so months the beer had improved significatly.  However it was very drinkable at 8 months.  The peanut butter taste wasn't very strong, the chocolate taste is what really prevailed.  The beer does have a kick.
