## Brew Notes
Racked to secondary after 10 days.  Racked to secondary (again because we forgot) after 10 weeks.  Bottled on July 2nd.  

Added apricot flavoring at when bottling. First batch (golden caps) had ~.75% apricot flavoring by volume.  Second batch (black caps) had ~1.25% apricot flavoring by volume.
