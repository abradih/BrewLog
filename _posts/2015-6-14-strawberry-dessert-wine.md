## Ingredients
23.3 lbs. processed and mashed strawberries, 12 lbs. rock candy sugar, 1/4 teaspoon sodium metabisulfite, 5 teaspoons pectic enzymes, 5 teaspoons yeast nutrient, 2 packages Champagne yeast

## Recipe
We followed the strawberry dessert wine recipie at [http://www.eckraus.com/wine-making-strawberry](http://www.eckraus.com/wine-making-strawberry).

## Brew Notes
The recipie called for 25 pounds of strawberries, but was unclear about wether that was 25 pounds raw or processed strawberries.  We started with about 30-35 pounds and ended up with 23.3 pounds of processed strawberries after trimming the greens, soft or rotten bits, and eating quite a few.  We used a potato masher to mash up the strawberries.  We didn't quite wait a whole 24 hours (closer to 17 hours) before transfering the juice liquer to the primary fermentation because of time constraints. For kicks we used rock candy instead of table sugar.
