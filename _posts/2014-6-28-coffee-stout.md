## Ingredients
6 lbs. darl liquid malt extract, 8 oz. chocolate malt, 4 oz. flaked barley, 4 oz. caramel 60L, 4 oz. roasted barley, Safale Ale S-04 Whitbread strain dry yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/peace-coffee-java-stout-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/659/Peace%20Coffee%20Java%20Stout%20instructions.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Generally did not deviate from the recipe instructions.  I ground the coffee grounds using a hand grinder and used a pour over to brew the coffee.

## Tasting Notes
I brought the whole batch along with some others to a wedding party.  It got mixed reviews, some people were crazy about it, others including myself thought the coffee was far too strong.
